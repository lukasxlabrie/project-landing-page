This landing page is will represent the sum of my knowldge thus far within HTML and CSS.
The focus will be on using Flex Box to create a tasteful layout deisgn (which has been provided via TOP)
I will use the information they provided but will create my own theme, use my own images, and choose my own colors.
Long story short, I will copy the template but make it my own vison. 

The goal here is to is to get as close as possible to the porvided template (small variances in things like pixels in margins are expected)

The subject for the page will me instrumental trio "Turtle Fur".
